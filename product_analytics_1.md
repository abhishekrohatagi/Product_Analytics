## **User Acquisition – Core Fundamentals**

### **What is User Acquisition?**

* Process of gaining new users for a platform.
* Focuses on **both quality & quantity** of users.
* Covers entire journey: **Discovery → App Install → Signup → First Purchase**.

---

## **Key KPIs (Metrics) in User Acquisition**

### **1️⃣ Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

* Money spent to acquire one user.
* **Formula:**
  Total Marketing Spend ÷ No. of New Users
* Example:
  $100 spend / 10 users = **$10 CAC**
* Quick commerce/grocery apps benchmark ≈ **$12–$15 per user**.
* Goal: Recover CAC through repeated orders (typically within 6–8 orders).

---

### **2️⃣ Conversion Rate**

Track conversion across the funnel:

1. App store visit → App Install
2. Install → Signup
3. Signup → First Order

* Example Funnel:

  * 100 people view app
  * 35–40% install
  * 60–65% of installers signup
  * 20–30% of those place first order
* Final actual order conversion often **5–7%** from initial viewers.

---

### **3️⃣ Time to First Order**

* Measures:
  **Sign-up → First Purchase Time**
* Shorter time = better performance.
* Constantly optimized.

---

## **User Acquisition Channels**

### **Organic Channels**

✔ App Store Optimization (ASO)
✔ Good app ratings
✔ Right keywords + attractive images
✔ Word of Mouth
✔ Referral programs
✔ Social proof & testimonials

---

### **Paid Channels**

✔ Social media ads
✔ Weekend targeting (example: quick grocery need)
✔ Google Search / Apple Search Ads
✔ Intent-based targeting (people searching for delivery)

---

## **Three Pillars of Measuring User Acquisition**

### **1️⃣ Growth (Volume)**

* How many users added?
* Week-on-week / Month-on-month growth
* Seasonal trends?

---

### **2️⃣ Quality**

* Are users engaging?
* Did they place first order?
* Are they retained over time?
* Is **Average Order Value (AOV)** increasing?

---

### **3️⃣ Efficiency**

* Are users acquired at the right price?
* Are we overspending?
* **Payback Period:**
  Time taken to recover CAC.
* **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):**
  Revenue expected from a user over time.

Absolutely—here’s a **cleaner, sharper, smarter** version of the lecture, designed the way a great instructor would teach it. It’s structured, logical, practical, and much clearer than the transcript.

# **A Much Better Version of the Lecture: CAC, LTV & Payback – The Real Business Engine**

## **1️⃣ Why This Topic Is a Big Deal**

Businesses don’t succeed because they get users.
They succeed only if:

* they get users **at the right cost**
* those users **bring enough value**
* and the business **recovers money fast enough**

That’s exactly what **CAC, LTV and Payback Period** tell you.

Think of it like this:

* **CAC = How expensive is it to bring a customer in?**
* **LTV = How much money does that customer give you over time?**
* **Payback Period = How long before this customer “repays” what you spent to get them?**

If you understand these three, you understand the economics of ANY business.

---

## **2️⃣ Before This Topic – What You Already Mastered**

You already learned how users enter the funnel:

### ✅ Acquisition Metrics

Measured at each stage of user journey:

* CPC (Cost Per Click)
* CTR (Click Through Rate)
* CPI (Cost Per Install)
* Install → Registration Conversion

👉 These tell **how efficiently you are attracting users**.

---

### ✅ Quality & Profitability Metrics

These tell what happens after acquisition:

* CPA (Cost per Action)
* ROAS (Return On Ad Spend)
* Payback Period
* LTV (Lifetime Value)

👉 These tell **if users are actually worth acquiring**.

---

### ✅ Channel Performance

Different channels perform differently for different businesses:

* E-commerce → Marketplaces & Search Channels
* New brands → Google + YouTube work great
* Mobile Apps → App Store & Play Store ads

That brings us to the hero of today’s discussion…

---

# **3️⃣ Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

## **What is CAC?**

CAC is the **total cost required to acquire ONE paying customer**.
Not just ads.
Not just marketing.
**Total acquisition effort.**

---

## **How Do We Calculate It?**

### **Formula**

[
CAC = \frac{\text{Total Acquisition Spend}}{\text{Number of New Customers}}
]

Acquisition spend includes:

* Marketing costs
* Sales costs
* Supporting tools and resources

---

### **Example**

Suppose in one month:

* Marketing Spend = $15,000
* Sales Cost = $30,000
* Total = $45,000
* Customers Acquired = 250

[
CAC = \frac{45000}{250} = $180
]

So each customer costs **$180** to acquire.

---

## **Break CAC Down — Because That’s Where Optimization Lives**

High intelligence businesses don’t just calculate CAC…
They **analyze where it comes from.**

### **Marketing Costs**

* Paid Ads
* Content creation
* Creative & video costs
* Agency fees

### **Sales Costs**

* Sales team salaries
* Referral commissions
* First-order discounts

### **Other Costs**

* Attribution tools
* CRM systems
* Marketing team salaries
* Analytics tools

Once you break CAC down,
👉 you know EXACTLY what to optimize
👉 what to cut
👉 where to double down

---

# **4️⃣ Why CAC Is So Powerful**

### **A. Profitability**

Compare CAC with LTV

* If **LTV > CAC → Business earns**
* If **CAC > LTV → Business bleeds**

### **B. Marketing Efficiency**

CAC helps you identify:

* Which channel works?
* Which campaign wastes money?
* Which customers are expensive to acquire?
* Where should we scale?

CAC is not just a number.
It’s a **decision-making tool**.

---

# **5️⃣ Payback Period — The Missing Bridge**

Even if LTV is greater than CAC, timing matters.

### **Payback Period**

How long does it take to recover CAC?

---

### **Example**

You spend:

* $100 CAC per customer

Customer pays:

* $20 per month

So you recover CAC in:
[
\frac{100}{20} = 5 \text{ months}
]

✔️ First 5 months = recovering cost
✔️ After 5 months = profit zone

Faster payback = stronger cash flow
Slower payback = capital stress

This is why investors care deeply about payback.

---

# **6️⃣ Lifetime Value (LTV)**

### **What is LTV?**

LTV = **Total revenue a customer generates over their lifetime with your product**

LTV tells you:

* how valuable your customers really are
* how much you can afford to spend on CAC
* how sustainable your business is

---

## **Golden Rule of Healthy Businesses**

[
\textbf{LTV should be at least 3× CAC}
]

Meaning:
For every ₹1 spent acquiring a user
You should make ₹3 in return

---

# **7️⃣ Quick Commerce Example (Blinkit / Zepto / Swiggy Instamart)**

### **Direct Costs**

* Paid ads
* Discounts
* Free delivery offers

### **Indirect Costs**

* Operations salaries
* Warehousing
* Agencies
* Analytics tools
* App store fees
* CRM costs

All of these affect:
✔ CAC
✔ Payback
✔ Profitability

---

# **8️⃣ Final Business Understanding**

A powerful business balances three things:

| Metric         | Meaning                    | Goal                |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| CAC            | Cost to acquire            | As low as possible  |
| LTV            | Money earned from customer | As high as possible |
| Payback Period | Time to recover CAC        | As fast as possible |

When:

* **CAC ↓**
* **LTV ↑**
* **Payback ↓**

You have a **scalable, profitable, unstoppable business**.
